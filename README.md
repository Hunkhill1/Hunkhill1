Hi there!!

Welcome to my Github profile. My name is Sahil Narula  ^.^

I am a fresh graduate from a prestigious university called, The University of Western Australia (¬‿¬). I graduated with a Bachelor of Science - Computer Science, Cybersecurity and Data Science (minor).

I am actively looking for employment opportunties in my field of study (((φ(◎ロ◎;)φ))).

I am a crazy Open world game fanatic, they are my go to, to unwind and relax. Some of my favorites are Horizon Zero Dawn, Horizon Forbidden West and Elden Ring!

I am predominantly a Windows and Linux OS user.

There are an absolute multitude of programming languages, environments and coding frameworks that I am proficent in. They are, and not limited to, `C`, `C++`,`Java`,`Python`,`HTML`,`CSS`,`JS`,`Flask`,`SQL`,`R`,`Ubuntu and Kali`,`OpenGL`,`GLUT`,`gym-super-mario`,
`shell scripting`,`and a lot more!`.

I am currently building a website, I had paused for a little but, construction is heavily underway!  (Here's the link incase you'd like a peek: https://sahils-website-a71e2caa0565.herokuapp.com)

I really want to implement threeJS into my website, and I am currently working on making/getting a model of one of the robotic animals from Horizon Zero dawn to be a model in my website.
